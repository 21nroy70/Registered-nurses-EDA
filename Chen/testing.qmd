```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nurses <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/36-SURE.github.io/main/data/nurses.csv")
head(nurses)
count(nurses)

# want to explore a hypothesis 


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# yearly total employment (State)
# potential research questions: how does employment vary across different years and is there a relationship between employment rate and hourly wage 
# Location Quotient: if u randomly sample someone, 5x more likely to get a healthcare in this specific state vs nationally; location quotient < 1 would mean 

# potential hypothesis--places with higher location quotients will have higher wages at some percentile; if location quotient is very low, nurses are in high demand, so their wages would be high
# 10th percentile: 10% of people make less than that, 90% of people make more than that 
# bring in unemployment rate for each state from other data source--when unemployment rate goes up, 

# each row represent a specific employment rate for a state by year 

table(nurses$State)
table(nurses$Year)
# facet by year

# top 10 most populated (total employed RN), how does top 10 differ by bottom 10 overall or by year 

nurses |>
  select(State, Year, `Total Employed RN`) |>
  group_by(State) |>
  summarize(ave=mean(`Total Employed RN`)) |>
  arrange(-ave)

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
